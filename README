INTRODUCTION:
=============
This script will build buildtools for i386-pc-baremetal machines. In particular it will compile:

binutils (ld, bfd, gas)
gmp
mpfr
gcc (gcc, g++, gfortran)
newlib

USAGE:
======
To use this, add OS specific hooks to the stubs in newlib-files/ and edit build.sh line 1 and give the name of the os target.
To build the baremetal toolchain, un-comment/comment/set the following script variables in build.sh:

PREFIX=/opt/toolchains/i386-pc-baremetal
DOWNLOAD=1
EXTRACT_n_PATCH=1
RECOMPILE_ALL=1

then simply run
./build.sh

This will build the tools and install them in the $PREFIX directory.

FEATURES:
=========

1. Will compile a complete C, C++ compiler toolchain.

PREREQUISITES:
